#Geog173 Group Project
#This script can help the user find three closest charing stations based on his or her current location.
#The result will be printed as a map book. On each map, we will include couple information about that charging station

#we will create map book from this result layer. 



#The first step to do is let the user enter his or her location, X is longitude and Y is latitude. 
#Bascially we create a point geometry on the map.
